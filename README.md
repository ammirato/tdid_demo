`demo.py` is the main file. Where everything happens.

`configDemo.py` has some configuration parameters for loading the model. I think probably at least 90% of them are not used in the demo, the file is copied from another project.

`REAMDE2.0.md` the read me from the project that trains the detection model. [github](https://github.com/ammirato/target_driven_instance_detection)
